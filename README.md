# AIUB Grading System (CGPA Calculator)

A simple, dark-mode CGPA calculator web UI made as an AIUB student project.

## Disclaimer
This is not AIUB's official website. It is a project developed by an AIUB student.

## Project Structure
- `frame/` — Main web UI (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`)
- `assets/` — Static assets (e.g., `aiub-logo.png`)
- `source/` — Java source (optional/legacy)

## Run Locally
You can open the HTML directly, but using a local server is recommended.

From the project root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 5173
```

Then open:
- `http://localhost:5173/`
- or `http://localhost:5173/index.html`

## Notes
- Enter your current CGPA and completed credits, then add your current-semester courses to calculate Semester GPA and updated CGPA.

## Thank You so much for using AIUB CGPA Calculator!
